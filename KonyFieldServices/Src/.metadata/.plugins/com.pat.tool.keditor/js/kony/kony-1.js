	/**This API enables you to specify whether:

The pre-show and post show events are invoked when you press Back button on your device.
The pop-up is modal (requires interaction before it can return to the parent application).
The App menu has to be updated when pre-show and post show events are invoked when you press the Back button on your device.
App menu has to be configured in pre-show/post show of each form, if each form has separate app menu buttons/items. But on some Kony platforms, pre-show and post show events are triggered when user navigates back using Back button and on some other platforms, those events are not triggered. If pre-show/post show event is not triggered, form cannot update its app menu. In this scenario, ideally, form should retain its app menu whatever was set earlier.

To ensure consistency while porting application across platforms, the setapplicationbehavior API enables you to set the default behavior of pre-show and post show events, a pop-up, and app menu.

Note: This API can only be called in post-appinit() method.
	* @param Objectbehaviors {Object}This an Object with the following key-value pairs:

invokePreshowPostShowEventsOnDeviceBack [Boolean]: Specifies if the preshow or postshow events are triggered when the user presses the back button.
isPopupModel [Boolean]: Specifies if the Popup is modal (requires interaction before it can return to the parent application). The value set as the property for a popup takes precedence over the value set dynamically.
retainSpaceOnHide [Boolean]: Specifies whether the space allocated for a widget is retained when the widget is made invisible. Applicable on widgets placed in a percentage container.

Important:  

Limitation in Windows channel: when retainSpaceOnHide is true and widget isVisible property is false, top and bottom margins will not be considered for invisible widget.
When visibility of widget is changed and when retainSpaceOnHide is true, there should not be any change in the width of HBox or % scrollBox. Height will change to the max height of the visible child widget.
When retainSpaceOnHide property is made False, inconsistency among platforms is observed. If any of the widgets placed inside a container are made invisible, then some platforms will retain the space and some platforms will not retain the space. To overcome this inconsistency or to retain the space in all platforms, retainSpaceOnHide property must be configured to True. The default value of retainSpaceOnHide property is True.
restoreformstateondeviceback [Boolean]: Specifies whether the default behavior of form app menu state is retained when the user presses the back button.
hideDefaultLoadingIndicator [Boolean]: If enabled (true), it hides the default loading indicator that appears when background operation is performed. For example, executing onClick() callback function of Button widget when a button is clicked.

Important: The hideDefaultLoadingIndicator property is available only on Android Platform and it is supported from Kony Android plug-in GA 5.0.32 onwards.

adherPercentageStrictly [Boolean]: By default, this parameter is set to true.

Note: SPA and Desktop Web supports only adherPercentageStrictly property.

defaultIndicatorColor [String]: Set color for the progress indicator. An hex code or a word can be used to set the color. The words can only be used for two colors "white" and "grey" and these words are not case sensitive.

Note: The defaultIndicatorColor property is only support for Android and Windows. Default color might vary for each platform as it picks from application theme, form color or pre-defined color.

hideDefaultLoadingIndicator [Boolean]: Set as true to hide the loading indicator, and set as false to show the loading indicator.

marginsIncludedInWidgetContainerWeight [Boolean]: Set to True to apply margin calculations. Margins are calculated based on width of the parent box.
Note: The margin change is applicable only for percentage boxes.

skinImageScaleMode [Constant]: Available on Windows Phone 8 or 8.1, Windows 8, and Desktop Kiosk

skinImageScaleMode [Constant]  Optional

skinImageScaleMode accepts the following constants:

constants.SKIN_IMAGE_SCALE_MODE_DEFAULT

constants.SKIN_IMAGE_SCALE_MODE_NONE

constants.SKIN_IMAGE_SCALE_MODE_FILL

constants.SKIN_IMAGE_SCALE_MODE_UNIFORM

constants.SKIN_IMAGE_SCALE_MODE_UNIRFORMTOFILL

SKIN_IMAGE_SCALE_MODE_DEFAULT: This mode renders the Images provided to the skin according to the existing, default behavior.
SKIN_IMAGE_SCALE_MODE_NONE: This mode does not scale the Images provided to the skin. In case the image is larger than the control, the widget expands to the size of the image, else, the image occupies its actual height within the control.


SKIN_IMAGE_SCALE_MODE_FILL: The image is scaled to fill the size of the widget in this mode. Its aspect ratio is not preserved.


SKIN_IMAGE_SCALE_MODE_UNIFORM: The image is scaled to fill the size of the widget while ensuring its aspect ratio is preserved.


SKIN_IMAGE_SCALE_MODE_UNIFORMTOFILL: The image is resized to fill the widget dimensions while preserving the native aspect ratio. If the aspect ratio of the widget differs from that of the image, the image is clipped to fit in the destination.


Example: kony.application.setApplicationBehaviors({skinImageScaleMode:constants.SKIN_IMAGE_SCALE_MODE_DEFAULT});

Usage Guidelines or Restrictions or Examples: In Kony Platform, height cannot be fixed for most of the widgets. Hence, for the widgets, for which the height is not fixed, the image skin will expand and the widgets size will grow for the modes: FILL, UNIFORM and UNIFORMTOFILL. This flag is usually set in Pre-AppInit or Post-Appinit before the widgets are rendered. In the scenario where the flag is modified after any of the widgets are rendered, there will be no change in the widgets which have already been rendered. The change will be reflected by the widgets which have not been rendered yet.
Following Windows 7 specific properties are added in setApplicationBehaviour API.

Note: All the properties must be passed as a key value pairs under Windows 7 Key.

backOnEsc: If set to True, allows user to go back to previous form by pressing Escape key. If the user is on the first form, the operation is ignored. Default value is False.

Note: If you are using onDeviceBack property on the form, the app will override the backOnEsc property and gives priority to onDeviceBack property.

minWidth: Allows to set minimum width of the main window.

maxWidth: Allows to set maximum width of the main window.

minHeight: Allows to set minimum height of the main window.

maxHeight: Allows to set maximum height of the main window.

popupAsDialog: If this property is set to True, all the pop-ups will be displayed outside the main window. If set to False, pop-up displays embedded in main window. Default value is False.

saveState: If set to true, location and size of the main window will be saved between application session. Default is false.

Note: If the setApplicationBehaviour API is called multiple times, latest settings are considered and all old settings are overridden.

isScrollEventsAsync [Boolean]
Type: Boolean
Default Value: true
Description: All scroll events are executed asynchronously. If visual changes and calculations are done based on scroll properties and events (such as content scroll offset) then it is recommended to set isScrollEventsAsync to false thereby, executing the scroll events synchronously.
Platform Availability: Windows Phone 8/8.1. 


isLowLevelEventsAsync [Boolean]
Type: Boolean
Default Value: true
Description: onTouchStart, onTouchMove, onTouchEnd and onTouchCancel are classified as low level events. If these events are required to be executed synchronously then, isLowLevelEventsAsync must be set to false thereby, executing the low level events synchronously.
Platform Availability: Windows Phone 8/8.1

isGestureEventsAsync [Boolean]
Type: Boolean
Default Value: true
Description: All gesture events are executed asynchronously. By setting isGestureEventsAsync to false, the gesture events will be executed synchronously.
Platform Availability: Windows Phone 8/8.1.
